<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/TravisCarlson/amazon-web-services-infrastructure-in-a-few-clicks" target="_blank">Slides from my presentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/srqsoftware/06-24-2016_Amazon-Web-Services-Infrastructure-In-A-Few-Clicks" target="_blank">code from the demo</a> of Amazon Web Services at the [Sarasota Software Engineers User Group](http://www.meetup.com/SarasotaSoftwareEngineers/events/222958877/) last night.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) makes it easy for developers to set up and administer their own infrastructure (servers, file systems, databases, etc.) using a straightforward web console and/or command-line client. This presentation will give an introduction to using AWS and demo how to create a basic infrastructure in just a few clicks, schedule common operations tasks such as backups using a simple command line script, set up monitors and alerts to keep things running smoothly, and easily scale up the infrastructure to handle heavier workloads.
